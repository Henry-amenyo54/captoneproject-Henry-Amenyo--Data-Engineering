# Online Sales Data Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

## Aim and Objective

The aim of this analysis is to provide actionable insights that can help in making informed business decisions and optimizing sales strategies.

## About the Data

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, specifically from the link below:
[Online Sales Dataset - Popular Marketplace Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyanshverma27/online-sales-dataset-popular-marketplace-data?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=kaggle-dataset-share&utm_source=)

This dataset offers a detailed view of online sales transactions across various product categories. Each row corresponds to a unique transaction and includes information such as order ID, date, category, product name, quantity, unit price, total price, region, and payment method.

## Data Preparation

### 1. Load the Dataset

The dataset was imported into Power BI using the "Get Data" option. The appropriate file format (CSV) was selected, and the data was loaded into Power BI.

### 2. Review the Data

The dataset was examined to understand its structure and contents. Columns were checked to ensure they were correctly identified, and it was confirmed that there were no missing values or anomalies.

### 3. Data Cleaning

No data cleaning was necessary as there were no missing values or null columns.

### 4. Create Columns

New columns were created to facilitate analysis. These included a "Day of the Week" column and a "Month of the Year" column to help study sales trends over time.

## Visualization Design

The visualization dashboard is designed with a user-friendly layout that presents key insights and information clearly. The dashboard is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the data:

### 1. Overview

The top section provides an overview of key metrics, such as total sales revenue, total transactions, total number of unique products, and total units sold. This section includes summary cards and KPIs to quickly convey overall performance.

### 2. Sales Trends Over Time

Using the available dates, visualizations compare sales performance across different months and days of the week. This analysis identifies the best and worst performing months, as well as the days with high or low sales volumes. Funnel and line charts are used to illustrate these trends vividly.

### 3. Regional Analysis

This section focuses on regional sales analysis, displaying a bar chart that highlights sales performance across different regions. It helps identify regions with the highest and lowest sales volumes. From the visualization, North America made the highest sales, while Europe made the least.

### 4. Payment Method Analysis

A visualization compares sales volumes or revenue generated by different payment methods (debit card, credit card, and PayPal). This provides insights into customer payment preferences and behavior.

### 5. Decomposition Tree

A decomposition tree explains, in sequence, the relationships between region, product category, product name, unit price, and total revenue.

## Analysis and Insights

### Key Metrics

- Total sales revenue
- Total transactions
- Total number of unique products
- Total units sold

### Findings

1. The highest sales were recorded in January, likely due to New Year promotions.
2. North America consistently outperformed other regions in terms of monthly sales.

### Interpretation

Seasonal promotions significantly boost sales. North America's consistent sales performance could be attributed to the convenience of payment methods available in that region.

## Conclusion

### Summary

Sales performance is strong, with significant seasonal variations.

### Recommendations

1. Increase promotional activities throughout the year.
2. Implement additional payment methods in low-performing regions to address potential transaction failures due to payment complications.

### Future Work

Further analyze customer demographics to tailor marketing strategies more effectively.
